# NoHere - Stop Using @here

Inspired by the wonderful [nohello.com](https://www.nohello.com/), this is a simple appeal to people to stop spamming #general with @here every time they have a question. It's up and running at [nohere.info](https://www.nohere.info) - Feel free to passive-aggressively share it with all you co-workers!

## About
This is just a little 'hello world' project while I'm learning React Native. Feedback for code or ways to improve the appeal to human decency so it's more effective are welcome!
